# Bottleneck wineshop sales analysis


## Detailed Project Description:
In this project, as part of my data analyst training, I was tasked with supporting BottleNeck, a prestigious wine retailer, by analyzing their sales data. The goal was to reconcile two datasets—one from the ERP and another from the online store CMS—and provide insights into sales performance and pricing inconsistencies.

### Key Tasks and Objectives:

1. Data Reconciliation:

    - Merge the ERP data (product references, stock, and prices) with the CMS data (product names, descriptions, and number of sales).
  
    - Use an Excel file created by a previous intern to match product IDs between the ERP and the online store's SKU references.
  
2. Sales Analysis:

    - Calculate the revenue for each product and the total online sales revenue.
  
    - Identify potential errors in the product prices and perform a statistical analysis to detect anomalies.
  
3. Reporting:

    - Present the results in a clear and concise manner for the next management meeting (COPIL), including a graphical representation of pricing anomalies.
  
    - Provide a detailed report or notebook (using Python) to explain the process and findings, with suggestions for further improvements.

By completing these tasks, I provided BottleNeck with valuable insights that would help them streamline their operations and improve the accuracy of their pricing.
